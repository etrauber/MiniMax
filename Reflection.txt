Time and Space Inefficiency
- branching factor exponeitally growing number of states to search
- fact that you have to up to every base case then all the way back up - need to search every single node in tree and tree can be huge
- start saving values for computer to regonize 
    - recognizing similarites, trying to figure out patterns

Games work bad on
- multiple ppl can win 
- not a two player game 
- games with a massive braching factor
- chess, super inefficient, bc huge amounts of branchs
